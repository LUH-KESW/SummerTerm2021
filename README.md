> **⚠ Note: Road map for our exercises**
> 
> Since the official lecture period usually ends with July, we will have this month three exercises to try to catch up.
> 
> The upcoming exercises will be on:
> * 13.07.2021
> * 20.07.2021
> * 27.07.2021
> 
> With this hopefully we will be done will all the material of the exercises. Following that we will have a mock exam session to go over what an exam of the KESW lecture could look like.
>
> The dates here are subject to change depending on the speed on which we go though the exercises (more preparation for the exercises from your side should speed things along ;) ).
>
> I hope to see you all there next week.
